# activation_conditioned_watermarking
A mini-project in applying mechanistic interpretability to the real world. activation_conditioned_watermarking.py replicates the experiment in the google doc.

See requirements.txt for how to run.

(I plan on organizing this repository in the future and making a proper readme, but didn't have enough time).
